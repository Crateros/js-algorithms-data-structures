Common Operations:
-Add (Inserts new node relative to parent)
-Remove (Deletes node and entire sub-tree)
-Balance (Sorts tree making it optimal for searching)
-Find (search tree for given value in nodes data property)

Every node has no more than two children, left child is always less than parent,
right child is always greater.

Each step reduces search space by 1/2.... can find any node in 1 million node tree in n <=20 steps
